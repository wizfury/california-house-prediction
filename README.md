## California House Price Prediction App
This app predicts the median House Price in California based on the features.

### Dataset Details
This dataset was derived from the 1990 U.S. census, using one row per census block group. A block group is the smallest geographical unit for which the U.S. Census Bureau publishes sample data (a block group typically has a population of 600 to 3,000 people).

A household is a group of people living in a home. Since the average number of rooms and bedrooms in this dataset is provided per household, these columns may take surprisingly large values for block groups with few households and many empty houses, such as vacation resorts.
